I am a versatile Software Engineer with comprehensive experience in both backend and frontend development, proficient in Java, Python, and JavaScript. I specialise in frameworks such as Spring Boot, AngularJS, and ReactJS to build scalable, maintainable web applications. My expertise extends to using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Git for development and deployment, with strong skills in database management using MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Currently, as a Software Engineer at Yubi (Spocto), I lead the development of impactful projects, including a Spring Boot-based Field Service platform that optimised processes for public sector units. My frontend experience highlights ReactJS, modern hooks, and state management with Redux.

I have completed B.Tech in Computer Science with AI & ML from Vellore Institute of Technology. My project portfolio includes a Unity-based eye tracking game, a drone-powered waste management system, and a real-time violence scene analysis model.

I am certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and as an Artificial Intelligence Analyst by IBM. My career is driven by a passion for creating optimised, user-friendly applications and systems.
